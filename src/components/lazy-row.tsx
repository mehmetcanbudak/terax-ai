 * Native, scroll-safe list virtualization for long transcripts.

 * outside the viewport while keeping them in the DOM, so the scroll container's
 * height stays correct and any scroll-anchoring library wrapping the list (here
 * `use-stick-to-bottom`) is undisturbed. `contain-intrinsic-size: auto <h>`
 * supplies a placeholder height for off-screen rows and remembers each row's
 * real size after its first render, so scrolling back through history does not
 * jump. Unsupported WebViews simply ignore the properties and render normally.
 *
 * Do NOT wrap the actively streaming/last row in this: it is on-screen anyway,
 * and excluding it avoids a needless containment recalculation on every token.
