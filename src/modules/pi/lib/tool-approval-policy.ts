/**
 * Tool-approval policy resolution for the webview Pi agent.
 *
 * The Rust capability manifest (src-tauri/.../capabilities) is the single
 * authority for whether a tool runs automatically (`auto`), requires user
 * approval (`ask`), or is blocked (`deny`). The webview path consults it here
 * instead of a hardcoded list, which keeps native policy in sync and —
 * crucially — applies the real policy to MCP tools so an
 * MCP tool marked `ask` is no longer auto-executed.
 *
 * Native tools are named differently on each side (the manifest uses `bash`,
 * the webview agent exposes `bash_run`), so we translate. Built-in defaults act
 * as a safe fallback when the manifest can't be fetched; the manifest overlays
 * them as the authority when present.
