# End-to-end tests

These specs drive the real, packaged Terax binary through
[WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) and
[`tauri-driver`](https://v2.tauri.app/develop/tests/webdriver/), exercising the
native WebView the way a user would.

## Platform support

`tauri-driver` bridges WebDriver to the platform WebView driver. That driver
exists on **Linux** (WebKitWebDriver) and **Windows** (Edge WebDriver) only.
**There is no WebDriver for WKWebView on macOS**, so these tests cannot run on
the macOS dev machine. They run in CI on Linux (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
job `e2e`).

Authoring on macOS is fine: the spec files live outside `./src`, so they are
not type-checked or linted by the frontend toolchain, and CI is the source of
truth for execution.

## What is covered

Golden flows that need no AI provider, secrets, or network:

- `smoke.e2e.mjs` - the app boots, the React root renders, the app or
  workspace title is shown, and the tab bar plus a terminal pane mount on first
  launch.
- `tabs.e2e.mjs` - opening a terminal tab from the new-tab menu increases the
  tab count; closing a tab decreases it.
- `terminal.e2e.mjs` - a PTY-backed xterm mounts, accepts keystrokes through
  its helper textarea, and the UI stays responsive after a command.
- `command-palette.e2e.mjs` - Ctrl+Shift+P opens the cmdk palette (the global
  shortcut fires even with the terminal focused), typing filters, Escape closes.
- `new-editor.e2e.mjs` - Ctrl+E opens the new-file dialog; typing a name and
  pressing Escape cancels without writing a file.
- `ai-chat.e2e.mjs` - the AI chat surface end to end against a deterministic
  mock provider (no keys, no network). Sets the `terax.e2e` localStorage flag,
  reloads, opens the composer (Ctrl+I), sends a prompt, and asserts the mocked
  assistant reply streams in. This is the Phase C, Stage 0 scaffold.
- `pi-approval.e2e.mjs` - the Pi surface against the deterministic faux Pi
  provider. The mock emits `write_file` tool calls; approving must write a
  fixture through Rust `pi_agent_tool_execute`, while denying must leave the
  fixture absent.

### The mock provider (terax.e2e flag)

The chat surface needs a live BYOK provider, which these tests must not depend
on. Setting `localStorage["terax.e2e"] = "1"` (then reloading) swaps in a
deterministic offline `MockLanguageModelV3` (`src/modules/ai/lib/mockProvider.ts`)
that streams a canned reply. The flag also enables the Pi faux provider
(`src/modules/pi/bridge/pi-mock.ts`), registers a hidden `mock-echo` model,
makes it the default selection, and satisfies the composer's "has a provider"
gate. In normal use the flag is unset, so none of this is reachable and the
mock code stays in a lazily loaded chunk.

xterm renders to a WebGL canvas, so on-screen terminal text is not readable
through the DOM. The terminal spec asserts the input plumbing structurally
rather than scraping rendered output.

### Not yet covered (and why)

- **Theme switching** lives in a separate settings window; `tauri-driver`
  drives one WebView session at a time, so cross-window flows need extra
  plumbing.
- **Git history / git graph** needs a seeded git repository and a workspace
  with source-control context; worth adding once a fixture repo is wired into
  the CI job.
- **Breadcrumb cd navigation** depends on shell-integration OSC 7 sequences,
  which vary by the CI shell; it would be flaky without a pinned shell.

## Running locally (Linux)

```sh
# one-time: the WebDriver bridge and the WebKit driver
cargo install tauri-driver --locked
sudo apt-get install -y webkit2gtk-driver xvfb

# build the frontend and the release binary the driver will launch
pnpm install
pnpm build
export TAURI_CONFIG='{"app":{"windows":[{"label":"main","title":"Terax","width":800,"height":600,"minWidth":420,"minHeight":280,"decorations":false,"transparent":true,"visible":true,"dragDropEnabled":true}]}}'
pnpm tauri build --ci --no-bundle --config "$TAURI_CONFIG"

# run the specs (headless)
xvfb-run -a pnpm e2e
```

`pnpm e2e` runs `wdio run ./wdio.conf.mjs`. The config spawns `tauri-driver`
itself and points the session at `src-tauri/target/release/terax`. Build the
binary through the Tauri CLI so the production frontend assets are embedded;
plain `cargo build --release` can leave the app pointed at the dev server.

## Adding a spec

1. Add `e2e/specs/<name>.e2e.mjs` (the `.e2e.mjs` suffix is required by the
   `specs` glob in `wdio.conf.mjs`).
2. Prefer stable `data-testid` hooks over class names. Existing hooks:
   `tab-bar`, `new-tab-button`, `new-tab-terminal`, `terminal-pane`,
   `cwd-breadcrumb`, `command-palette-input`, `ai-composer-input`.
3. Keep specs free of AI providers, secrets, and network so they stay
   deterministic in CI.
