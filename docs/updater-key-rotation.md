# Updater signing-key rotation (2026-07)

The Tauri updater public key in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` was rotated:

| | minisign public key fingerprint |
|---|---|
| Old | `3BABFD8AB60E3469` |
| New | `52D6B9847A3B8F15` |

Update feed: `https://github.com/crynta/terax-ai/releases/latest/download/latest.json`.

This is intentional. This document is the cutover checklist and the migration
hazard it creates.

## Why this is delicate

The updater pubkey is **baked into each installed app at build time**. On update
check, a client downloads `latest.json` plus the release signature and validates
that signature against **its own embedded pubkey**. Therefore:

- A release signed with the **new** private key validates only on builds that
  embed the **new** pubkey (this build and everything shipped after it).
- Every **already-installed** client still embeds the **old** pubkey. It will
  **reject** a release signed only with the new key, so its in-app auto-update
  silently stops working. Those users must reinstall manually (or be migrated by
  a transition release; see below).

So rotating the key is safe going forward but strands the existing install base
unless handled deliberately.

## Cutover checklist (must all be true before publishing the next release)

1. **Private key in CI.** The minisign secret matching `52D6B9847A3B8F15` is set
   as the release signing secret (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` +
   `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`) in the release workflow's secrets.
   Confirm the new key signs and the old secret is removed/retired.
2. **Old private key retired/secured.** If the rotation is due to suspected
   compromise, revoke the old key everywhere and never sign with it again.
3. **Release signature verifies against the new pubkey** locally before publish
   (`minisign -V` against `52D6B9847A3B8F15`).
4. **Existing-install migration decided** (pick one, document the choice in the
   release notes):
   - *Accept the break*: announce that users on builds <= the last old-key
     release must reinstall once; or
   - *Transition release*: ship one more build signed with the **old** key whose
     payload is the new-key build, so old clients accept the update and land on
     the new pubkey. (Tauri does not support dual-signing one artifact, so this
     is a staged hop, not a single release.)
5. **Release notes** state the key rotation and the user action (if any).

## Verification

Use `pnpm run inspect:updater-feed -- [latest.json-or-url] --expect-key <KEY_ID>`
to decode every platform signature in a Tauri `latest.json` feed and fail if any
platform is signed by an unexpected key. Without a path or URL, the command
inspects the public latest feed. Record maintainer-run evidence in
`docs/updater-key-rotation-smoke-report.md`.

- New installs: install this build, trigger an update check against a test feed
  signed with the new key, confirm it applies, and run
  `pnpm run inspect:updater-feed -- <test-feed-url> --expect-key 52D6B9847A3B8F15`.
- Old installs: install a pre-rotation build, point it at a feed signed with the
  new key, confirm it **rejects** (proves the threat model), run the inspector
  against the feed used for the chosen migration path, and confirm that path
  (reinstall or transition release) works.

## Release-notes draft

Use exactly one of these notes for the release that ships the rotated updater
key, after the maintainer chooses the migration path.

### Preferred transition-release path

> This release rotates Terax's updater signing key. Existing installations can
> update normally through the in-app updater because this transition release was
> signed with the previous trusted key and installs a build that trusts the new
> key. Future updates will be signed with the new key.

### Fallback reinstall-announcement path

> This release rotates Terax's updater signing key. Existing installations built
> before this release cannot verify the new update signature through the in-app
> updater. If your app does not update automatically, download and install the
> latest Terax release manually once; future updates will work normally from the
> new signing key.

## Status

- [x] Pubkey rotated in `tauri.conf.json` to `52D6B9847A3B8F15`.
- [x] Local config audit confirms the embedded updater pubkey decodes to `untrusted comment: minisign public key: 52D6B9847A3B8F15`.
- [x] Release workflow wiring audit confirms the current `.github/workflows/release.yml` passes `secrets.TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `secrets.TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` into `tauri-apps/tauri-action@v1`. There is no separate AppImage re-sign step in the current workflow; if one is added later, re-audit that it receives the same new-key secrets.
- [x] Static local verifier added: `pnpm check:updater-key-rotation` decodes the embedded Tauri updater pubkey, checks the expected release feed endpoint, and verifies the release workflow signing env wiring.
- [x] Feed signature inspector added: `pnpm run inspect:updater-feed -- [latest.json-or-url] --expect-key <KEY_ID>` decodes Tauri feed platform signatures and fails if any platform uses the wrong minisign key id.
- [x] Live feed audit confirms the current public `v0.8.2` `latest.json` exists and all embedded platform signatures carry old key id `3BABFD8AB60E3469`, while this branch embeds new pubkey `52D6B9847A3B8F15`. This means a build from this branch cannot validate the current public latest feed until a new-key signed release or test feed exists.
- [x] Migration recommendation chosen: prefer a **transition release** if the old private key is still trusted/available, because it preserves auto-update for existing installs. If the rotation was caused by suspected compromise or the old key is unavailable, fall back to the reinstall announcement path.
- [ ] New private key value verified in release CI secrets (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` and `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`). The current agent cannot verify or set repository secrets: `gh secret list --repo crynta/terax-ai --app actions` returned HTTP 403 again on 2026-07-07.
- [ ] Transition-release feasibility confirmed by a maintainer with access to the old updater private key and release workflow secrets.
- [x] Release-note draft prepared for both migration outcomes above.
- [x] Maintainer-fillable updater smoke report added at `docs/updater-key-rotation-smoke-report.md` for fresh new-key install, pre-rotation rejection, transition/reinstall migration evidence, and release-note/secret hygiene.
- [ ] Existing-install migration path noted in the actual release notes for the release that ships this change.
- [ ] End-to-end update verified on a new install and an old install against a signed test feed.

## Current blocker

The remaining updater-key-rotation work requires maintainer-held signing secrets and release-workflow access. The local agent can build unsigned app/updater artifacts for size checks, confirm the workflow references the expected secret names, and inspect any public or local feed with `pnpm run inspect:updater-feed`. The current public feed is still signed with the old key, so it is useful evidence for the pre-rotation state but cannot prove fresh new-key updater acceptance. Fresh/pre-rotation acceptance still needs a signed release or test feed produced by the configured CI secrets and, for the recommended transition path, the old signing key.
