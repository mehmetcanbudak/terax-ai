# Phase C: ai/ -> pi convergence plan

Status: design landed 2026-06-12. Execution is staged and ongoing; each stage
below is independently shippable and independently verifiable.

## Why this is a design, not a single commit

The original SOTA plan framed Phase C as "fold the legacy `ai/` chat stack
(~10k LOC) onto pi sessions." Mapping the actual dependency graph changes the
shape of the work in two important ways:

1. **`ai/` is not one thing.** Of its ~13.5k LOC, only a minority is the chat
   *surface*. The rest is shared infrastructure and a general agent runtime that
   pi itself and many other features depend on. A blind "delete `ai/`" would
   break settings, workflow, model-compare, source-control, git-history,
   editor autocomplete, and the agents module.
2. **There is no blind-safe path.** The chat surface only does anything useful
   with a live BYOK provider (keys + network). The e2e harness deliberately
   excludes AI providers, secrets, and network to stay deterministic, so the
   converged surface cannot be regression-tested the way the terminal/tab flows
   can until a mock-provider fixture exists (Stage 0 below).

So Phase C is a sequence of small, reversible migrations behind a stable public
surface, not one cut. This document defines the target boundary and the order.

## The real boundary: three layers inside `ai/`

Mapped from `src/modules/ai/` and its ~55 external importers.

### Layer 1 - Shared infrastructure (STAYS; pi already consumes it)

Provider keys, model discovery, transport, and security. Pi and the rest of the
app already import these; they are not "legacy" and do not move.

- `lib/keyring.ts` (`ProviderKeys`, `getKey`/`setKey`/`hasAnyKey`, custom
  endpoints) - consumed by settings, pi, model-compare.
- `lib/modelDiscovery*.ts`, `lib/modelPrefs.ts`, `config.ts` - model catalog
  and per-provider defaults.
- `lib/transport.ts`, `lib/proxyFetch.ts`, `lib/security.ts`, `lib/redact.ts`
  - the SSRF-aware fetch path and secret redaction.
- `lib/composer.tsx` (`AiComposerProvider`) - the unconditionally-mounted
  composer context. Load-bearing for App; keep mounted.

Action: none structurally. Optionally re-home this layer under a neutral name
(e.g. `modules/ai-runtime/`) once Layers 2-3 stop importing each other, so the
name stops implying "legacy." Cosmetic; do last or never.

### Layer 2 - Agent runtime (SHARED; converges underneath, not deleted)

The AI-SDK-based run loop. Used by the chat surface AND by workflow nodes and
model-compare, so it cannot be deleted with the surface.

- `store/chatStore.ts` (695 LOC) - `getOrCreateChat`, `sendMessage`, `stop`,
  `useChatStore`, agent-run status/meta. Imported by workflow, model-compare,
  source-control, agents.
- `lib/agent.ts`, `lib/transport.ts`, `tools/*` (the AI-SDK tool impls),
  `agents/*` (subagent registry/run).

Target: this is where convergence actually happens. Pi's runtime
(`pi-agent-core` + the Rust-mediated native tool boundary) is the SOTA target
runtime; the AI-SDK loop is the legacy one. The two must present one run-status
model to consumers before either the surface or the runtime can be unified. See
Stage 2.

### Layer 3 - Chat surface (the FOLD target; parallels pi's surface)

The presentation that duplicates what pi already has.

| Concern            | Legacy `ai/`                         | SOTA `pi/`                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Composer           | `AiInputBar`, `lib/composer.tsx`     | `PiComposer`              |
| Transcript         | `AiChat`, `AiChatMessage`            | `PiTranscript`           |
| Floating window    | `AiMiniWindow`                       | `PiFloatingWindow`       |
| Tool approval      | `AiToolApproval`                     | native approval gate      |
| Run extras         | `PlanDiffReview`, `TodoStrip`        | (to be absorbed)          |
| Stores             | `planStore`, `todoStore`, `snippetsStore` | pi session store     |

Already converged (down-payment, landed): `src/components/lazy-row.tsx` -
`PiTranscript` and `AiChat` now share one virtualization primitive
(`content-visibility`) instead of two ad-hoc render caps. This is the pattern:
extract the genuinely-shared primitive, point both surfaces at it, then retire
the legacy side once pi covers the affordance.

## Migration sequence

Each stage is shippable on its own and leaves the app working. Stop after any
stage without leaving a half-migration.

### Stage 0 - Verification scaffold (prerequisite, do first) [DONE 2026-07-07]

Without this, none of the surface stages can be regression-tested.

- Add a **mock provider** behind the existing BYOK transport: a deterministic
  fake that streams canned assistant turns and tool calls, selectable via an
  env flag the app already threads for tests. No real keys, no network.
- Add e2e specs that drive the chat surface against the mock: send a prompt ->
  assistant streams -> a tool call requests approval -> approve -> run
  completes. Mirror for pi sessions.
- This makes the surface a tested surface, which is the precondition for
  changing it.

**Landed.** `src/modules/ai/lib/mockProvider.ts` and the shared
`terax.e2e` flag provide a deterministic AI-SDK mock for the legacy chat
surface. `e2e/specs/ai-chat.e2e.mjs` drives composer -> transport -> store ->
transcript with no keys and no network. The Pi mirror uses
`src/modules/pi/bridge/pi-mock.ts`, which registers a faux pi provider and emits
sentinel write-file tool calls. `e2e/specs/pi-approval.e2e.mjs` covers both
approval outcomes: approve creates `e2e/.tmp/pi-approval-approved.txt` through
Rust `pi_agent_tool_execute`, while deny leaves
`e2e/.tmp/pi-approval-denied.txt` absent. `scripts/check-pi-approval-boundary.mjs`
guards the spec, sentinel prompts, mock wiring, WebdriverIO glob, and Linux e2e
CI command.

### Stage 1 - One run-status contract (Layer 2, no surface change) [DONE 2026-06-12]

- Define a single `AgentRun` view-model (normalized phase + `busy` + usage +
  step + error) that both `chatStore` and pi sessions can produce.
- Have both runtimes expose it; repoint the cross-runtime run-status consumers
  at the new contract. No UI change; verified by unit tests plus Stage 0.

**Landed.** `src/modules/ai/lib/agentRun.ts` owns the normalized `AgentRunPhase`
(`idle | preparing | streaming | awaiting-approval | error`) and maps both
vocabularies onto it: `chatStatusToPhase` (chat's `AgentRunStatus`) and
`piStatusToPhase` (`PiSessionStatus`), plus `chatMetaToAgentRun` /
`piSessionToAgentRun` builders and `isAgentBusy`. Status types are imported
type-only so the module is a dependency-light leaf (no cycle with `chatStore`).

**Scope refinement found while mapping the code:** the plan assumed four shared
consumers needed repointing. In fact only **source-control**
(`useSourceControlPanel.ts`) reads run *status* from `chatStore`
(`agentMeta.status`, used solely to derive `aiBusy`). Workflow, model-compare,
and agents import `chatStore` for shared *infrastructure* (`apiKeys`,
`customEndpointKeys`, `selectedModelId`, `getOrCreateChat`) - Layers 1-2, not
run status - so they do not change in Stage 1. Source-control now selects
`chatStatusToPhase(state.agentMeta.status)` and derives `aiBusy` via
`isAgentBusy`, behavior-identical today and runtime-agnostic for Stage 2. The
pi producer (`piSessionToAgentRun`) is tested and ready, and goes live when the
composer is pi-backed. 6 mapper tests in `agentRun.test.ts`.

### Stage 2 - Pi runtime backs the quick-ask composer (Layer 2/3 seam) [SEAM LANDED 2026-06-12]

- Make the docked composer (`AppComposerDock` -> `AiInputBar`) able to create a
  lightweight pi session instead of an AI-SDK chat, behind a flag.
- Keep `AiInputBar`'s look; swap the runtime. Verify with Stage 0 specs on both
  paths, flip the flag default once green.

**Pi runtime landed behind a flag 2026-07-08.**
`src/modules/ai/lib/composerRuntime.ts` has both composer runtimes and
`AiComposerProvider` consumes that runtime seam. Chat is still the default.
Setting `localStorage["terax.pi.composerRuntime"]` to `"pi"` (or `"1"` /
`"true"`) selects the Pi-backed runtime.

When the flag is enabled, the docked `AiInputBar` keeps its existing UI but sends
text parts to `webviewSessionSend`. The runtime creates a lightweight "Quick
ask" Pi session on first send, reuses either that session or the currently
selected Pi session, publishes the created-session event so mounted Pi surfaces
see it, opens/focuses the Pi code panel through App-level activation wiring, and
passes the same workspace/file/terminal prompt context used by `PiPanel`. Local
busy state now keeps stop wired to `webviewSessionStop` while the Pi turn is in
flight.

Verification: `src/modules/ai/lib/composerRuntime.test.ts` covers the
localStorage gate, selection-text send path, prompt context, session reuse, and
stop behavior. `src/modules/ai/lib/composer.test.tsx` proves the flagged
`AiComposerProvider` path calls `webviewSessionSend` instead of legacy
`getOrCreateChat`. The flag is intentionally not default-on until the manual
macOS smoke pass and updater verification are green.

### Stage 3 - Retire duplicate surface pieces

- Replace `AiMiniWindow` usage with `PiFloatingWindow` (already exists).
- Fold `PlanDiffReview` and `TodoStrip` into the pi transcript as turn
  affordances; migrate `planStore`/`todoStore` into the pi session store.
- Replace `AiChat`/`AiChatMessage` mounts with `PiTranscript`. Delete the
  legacy components only after their last importer is repointed.

**First mini-window routing step landed 2026-07-08.** When the Pi-backed
composer runtime is selected and provider config is ready, App-level
conversation open/focus handlers route status-bar agent surface buttons and
composer activation to the Pi code panel instead of opening the legacy AI mini
window. The legacy mini window remains mounted only for the default chat-runtime
path until the Pi composer flag can become the default after PR CI/e2e, manual
smoke, and updater verification are green. The floating `PiFloatingWindow`
component remains available, but this release path uses the always-mounted code
panel as the stable focus target.

**Residual surface audit 2026-07-07.** Current import search shows
`AiChat`, `AiChatMessage`, `PlanDiffReview`, and `TodoStrip` are only reached
through `AiMiniWindow` and their own tests. The Pi-backed path no longer mounts
that window, so those pieces are isolated to the fallback chat-runtime path.
Do not delete them until the Pi composer runtime becomes the default, because
that fallback still needs `AiChatView`, plan review, and todo strips for legacy
AI-SDK sessions. `PiTranscript` already owns the Pi-native replacement affordances
for streaming transcript rows, tool approval, questions, regenerate, fork, and
rollback. Legacy `planStore` and `todoStore` remain AI-SDK-only state and should
not be migrated into the Pi session store until a Pi-native plan or todo event
exists; otherwise Stage 3 would preserve legacy runtime state under a new name.

**Static isolation guard 2026-07-07.** `scripts/check-pi-surface-isolation.mjs`
now fails if production code imports `AiChat`, `AiChatMessage`,
`PlanDiffReview`, or `TodoStrip` outside the legacy mini-window chain. It is
chained through `pnpm run check:pi-boundary` so the deferred fallback cannot
silently grow new production entry points while the Pi composer runtime remains
behind its flag.

### Stage 4 - Runtime collapse and rename

- Once no surface uses the AI-SDK loop for sessions, reduce Layer 2 to the
  pieces workflow/model-compare still need (one-shot generations), and move
  Layer 1 + the residual runtime under `modules/ai-runtime/`. Drop the empty
  `ai/` surface directory.

## Verification strategy

- Layers 1-2 changes: existing unit tests + the Stage 0 mock-provider e2e.
- Layer 3 changes: Stage 0 e2e on both old and new surface during the flag
  window; visual parity is a manual check on Linux/Windows (where e2e runs).
- Never delete a legacy component in the same commit that repoints its last
  importer; land the repoint, confirm green, then delete in a follow-up so each
  step is revertible.

## What is explicitly NOT in scope

- Re-homing Layer 1 names is cosmetic and deferred to Stage 4 or skipped.
- The Rust native tool boundary is already the SOTA target and does not change.
- `PiControllerProvider` -> zustand stays dropped (see the 2026-06-11 progress
  log entry: it does not cause wide re-renders).
